                <h4>Retrieval</h4>
                <p>For retrieval, we make use of ensemble retrieval which combines two different retrieval systems and reranks the documents returned based on the weightage given to each system.</p>
                <p>We utilize BM25 and vector-based embedding retrieval systems. A document in our use case is a combination of restaurant name, description, service options, ratings, and all the user reviews. For embedding retrieval systems, we pre-compute the embedding vector for each restaurant's document, which are stored in a vector store using Chroma DB. While retrieving, we obtain 10 documents from BM25 based on a query and another 10 from the vector store. The 10 retrieved from the vector store are selected based on similarity with the embedding vector of the query.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, the ensemble retrieval system reranks those documents (restaurants) based on the weightage given to the underlying systems. Equal weightage is assigned to both BM25 and Embedding retrieval system.</p>
                <h4>Recommendation Model</h4>
                <p>We have used both item-item collaborative filtering and content-based similarity between two items:</p>
                <h5>ITEM-ITEM Collaborative Filtering:</h5>
                <p>We have the user-item ratings, recalculated the ratings of the user-item pair based on the rating and sentiment polarity of the review text, and built a matrix of user-item ratings.</p>
                <p>Calculated the Item-Item similarity based on Pearson similarity and created an ITEM-ITEM similarity matrix.</p>
                <h5>Content-based Filtering:</h5>
                <p>We have created an item-item similarity based on the content of each restaurant details such as Description, Category options available, Service Options, Accessibility options, and Reviews.</p>
                <p>Using the Bert-based embedding model, we have found the cosine similarity between the two items and created an ITEM-ITEM similarity matrix for all the items.</p>
                <p>Based on the above 2 similarity matrices, we have created a new similarity matrix containing the top 5 neighbors of each item, which are the most similar ones.</p>
                <h4>AI Generated Review Summarization model:</h4>
                <p>We have used the Langchain LLM model to summarize all the reviews generated by the users for a particular restaurant into a neutral summary, incorporating both positive and negative reviews. For Retrieval, we make use of ensemble retrieval, combining two different retrieval systems and reranking the documents returned based on weightage given to each system.</p>
                <p>We make use of BM25 and vector-based embedding retrieval systems. A document in our use case is a combination of restaurant name, description, service options, ratings, and all the user reviews. For embedding retrieval systems, we pre-compute the embedding vector for each restaurant's document. These vectors are stored in a vector store, using Chroma DB. While retrieving, we get 10 documents from BM25 based on a query and another 10 from the vector store. The 10 retrieved from the vector store are selected based on similarity with the embedding vector of the query.</p>
                <p>Then the ensemble retrieval system reranks those documents (restaurants) based on the weightage given to the underlying systems. Equal weightage is given to both BM25 and Embedding retrieval system. For the RAG part, we make use of the documents returned by the ensemble system. We extract only the name, description, rating, and service options from the documents, leaving out the reviews. This, along with the query, is passed to an LLM (LangChain API to define the RAG chain) with a prompt template to get the retrieval augmented generation text.</p>
